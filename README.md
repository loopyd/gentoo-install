## Q/A
**Did this actually take 3 months?**
The project was started June 06, 2019.  Its original repository deleted in a fit of rage.  Yes.  :v

**Will this work on my machine?**
Not without configuring your own kernel, editing its here document, and a few other things.  Gentoo is a learning experience.
Go learn and stop bothering me !

**What does it install?**
- nvidia proprietary
- kde plasma
- sddm, and all the goodies
- lvm partition
- on an nvme drive
- custom dracut initramfs
- custom linux-ck kernel

**How long does it take?**
On an 8 thread i7-6700k the installation takes 9:18:17 (timed as an ssh capture), that's **9 hours 18 minutes and 17 seconds**

**Are you NUTS?**
I like nuts.

**Why Gentoo?**
Fish heads, fish heads, roly poly fish heads.  Fish heads, fish headds, eat em up, yum.

Does that answer your question?

I'm sorry, 3 months in a terminal will do that to a person.

**I hate you, this destroyed my machine.**
THat isn't a question.  But I love you, too.  Should have read this document, eh?

**Can I buy you a cavfefe?**
You know what to do:  https://paypal.me/snowflowerwolf?locale.x=en_US

**Can I have your phone number?**
Sure, but it might dissapear in a week.
